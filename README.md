# Autonomous drone package delivery (Polyhack 2018)

This solution consists of the following four parts. 

1. Path planning and obstacle avoidance feature that collision-free generates waypoints that lead from a start to an end position. 
2. Package request handling feature that optimize over the capacity of the drones to maximize deliveries within a given time frame. 
3. The third feature takes the weights of different deliveries into account while assigning deliveries. 
4. Some initial developments for collision avoidance between different drones.
